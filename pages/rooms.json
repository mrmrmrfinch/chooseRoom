        "description": "The University took a pioneering step forward when the Interfaith Chapel was built in 1970. At that time, few schools could boast a facility intended to be a religious gathering place for all people. The Interfaith Chapel is a place for people to worship in their particular faith and a place where people of different faiths, or no religious tradition at all, can share in dialogue, worship, and interfaith education. Our multi-faith community and our interfaith engagements contribute significantly to the rich diversity that is the University of Rochester experience.",
